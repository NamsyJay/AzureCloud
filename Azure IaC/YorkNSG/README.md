# Dynamic Block

This Project demonstrates the implementation of Dynamic Blocks through the creation of multiple security rules as inline and sub-resources configurations.
By Dynamically generating security rules configurations, the code is resuable and maintainable. 
This method can be extended to the rresources beyond Network Security Groups (NSGs).
