## Landing Zone

A Landing Zone helps you plan for and design an Azure Deployment, by conceptualising designated areas for the placement and integration of resources.
There are 2 types.
### Platform Landing Zone - 
provides centralised enterprise-scale foundational services for workloads and applications.

### Application Landing Zone
provides services specific to an application or workload.

## Here are a few reasons to keep your landing zone up to date.
### Maintain improved security: Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving. It's important to ensure that your landing zone reflects the latest best practices for protecting your data and systems. Keeping your landing zone up to date helps you mitigate the risk of a security breach and helps you keep your data properly secured.

### Avoid platform configuration drift: As landing zones continue to evolve, drift relative to your deployed environment is introduced. Examples of drift include:
  - Replacement of landing zone policies by built-in Azure policies or by newer versions of landing zone policies.
  - Improvements to network features.
  - New features.
### Get support: A landing zone, as a deployable reference and implementation, is an open-source project, so support is limited to community engagement. Keeping your landing zone aligned to the current implementation makes community support more likely.
